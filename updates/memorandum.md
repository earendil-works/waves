Hello,

<span class="mono-light">This dispatch is a placeholder for the archive, stitched together to show the cadence of our updates.</span> The crew logged a calm run across the simulation bay, tuning beacons and mapping the next stretch of water.

We filed the notes under <span class="mono-spaced mono-caps">E A R E N D I L</span> and marked the signal lockers with <span class="mono-bold">heavier</span> stamps where needed.

<span class="mono-caps">Next cycle</span> we will swap in a steadier compass and leave a longer trail of breadcrumbs for whoever reads these pages.

With gratitude,

Colin Hanna and Armin Ronacher
