Hello,

We believe in building in the open — sharing what we learn, what we craft, and where we're headed. If you're curious about software that strengthens human agency and bridges understanding, we'd love to have you along for the journey.

<a href="/posts/subscribe/">[Subscribe to posts]</a> and we'll send occasional posts: honest reflections on what we're building, why it matters, and the open protocols we're shaping together.

No noise, just signal.

We work out of <span class="mono-bold">Vienna, Austria</span>, a city of coffee, culture, and good conversation. If you're passing through and want to say hello, drop us a line at <a href="mailto:hello@earendil.com">hello@earendil.com</a>. The door is open.

With care,  
Colin Hanna and Armin Ronacher
